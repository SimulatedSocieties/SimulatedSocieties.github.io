**SoBigData** is Pan-European, multi-disciplinary research infrastructure for big social data analytics, coupled with the consolidation of a cross- disciplinary European research community, aimed at using social mining and big data to understand the complexity of our contemporary, globally-interconnected society.

The project is the result of a long-term vision and started in 2015  with an initial project called SoBigData funded by H2020 (G.A. n. 654024) and is continuing  with a subsequent H2020 project called SoBigData++ (G.A. n. 871042).

#### Three siblings projects

**SoBigData++** is the first in a series of three projects, which are funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme and by the Italian government under the PNRR (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza). 

**SoBigData-PPP.** The RI entered the **ESFRI RoadMap 2021** and therefore supported in becoming a legal entity in the form of an ERIC: *SoBigData-PPP* is an ESFRI Preparatory Phase Project preparing the "go to market" strategy of the RI.

**SoBigData-PNRR.**. The technological development of the Italian node of the RI is also funded within the **PNRR**
