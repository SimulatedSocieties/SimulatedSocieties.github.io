The EU-funded <a href="https://www.humane-ai.eu/">**HumanE-AI-Net**</a> project brings together leading European research centres, universities and industrial enterprises into a network of centres of excellence. 
Leading global artificial intelligence (AI) laboratories will collaborate with key players in areas, such as human-computer interaction, cognitive, social and complexity sciences. 
The project is looking forward to drive researchers out of their narrowly focused field and connect them with people exploring AI on a much wider scale. 
The challenge is to develop robust, trustworthy AI systems that can ‘understand’ humans, adapt to complex real-world environments and interact appropriately in complex social settings.

**HumanE-AI-Net** will lay the foundations for designing the principles for a new science that will make AI based on European values and closer to Europeans.
