Migration represents a constantly rising social and political concern for many governments. 
As a result, a better understanding of the drivers and dynamics of migration is important to ensure effective and successful migration governance. 

The EU-funded <a href="https://hummingbird-h2020.eu/">**HumMingBird**</a> project intends to study the origins of migration and their interrelation with the tendency of people to emigrate. 
In this effort, the role migration data play is instrumental. 
Data will provide key information concerning drivers, geography, incentives and instruments related to the migration movements.

The project aims to identify whether past migration policies succeeded, assess eventual lack in prediction, and calculate existing and future impacts of today's migration policies.
